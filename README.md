@topic Clustering and Reordering

This is the code for the VeryLargeGraph course.

First run louvain algorithm (follow louvain README).

Then run reordering algorithm (again, follow reordering README).

And finally run again louvain to see the difference.

#Test Script

You can run a simple example on inet graph using ./compute_n_data.sh name_of_graph reordering_method

with reordering_method = rand | min | max
