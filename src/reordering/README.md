#Reordering

To run this code

- make
- ./reordering graph_to_compute outputfile

I reused code from Clemence Magnien: 

- its implementation of queues
- its implementation of graphs
- I also modified its bfs to return the nodes traversed
- And I implemented my function graph to file and of course the main function
